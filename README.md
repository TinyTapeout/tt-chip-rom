## What is this repo?

This repo contains a simple 8-bit ROM that describes the Tiny Tapeout shuttle. The ROM is generated by a [python script](tools/make_rom.py) and includes the shuttle id (tt04) and the repository name (TinyTapeout/tinytapeout-04). The ROM format is as follows:

| Address | Bytes | Description                                                      |
| ------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x00    | 4     | 7-Segment encoded shuttle id                                     |
| 0x20    | 96    | ASCII encoded text that describes the shuttle (key=value format) |
